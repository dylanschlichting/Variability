## This repository contains python scripts and jupyter notebooks used to study variability of surface hydrodynamics in the northern Gulf of Mexico. 

We are analyzing normalized surface vertical relative vorticity and both horizontal salinity gradients. The scripts that calculate these histograms are:
	zetaf.py
	salgrad.py
The control volume location and all resulting analysis is shown in:
	histogram_demonstration.ipynb.
The other notebooks are old analysis tools from Rob Hetland. Whether these are used are tbd. The outputs are sold in the histograms folder and all subdirectories.
